# word-search-generator

A Word Search Puzzle Generator developed on Angular 8.

## Usage
Put one or more words to add to the word search, along with its dimensions (width / height).
Once the "Generate" button has been pressed, a word search will appear based on the indicated parameters. To print it, use the corresponding button.

Please note that at the moment the application only supports A4 sheet size in portrait layout.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
