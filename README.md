# word-search-generator

A Word Search Puzzle Generator developed on Angular 8.

## Usage
Put one or more words to add to the word search, along with its dimensions (width / height).
Once the "Generate" button has been pressed, a word search will appear based on the indicated parameters.
Use the print dialog provided by the browser (usually CTRL + P), to print the puzzle without the data upload form.

Please note that at the moment the application only supports A4 sheet size in portrait layout.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
